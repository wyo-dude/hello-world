# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. Yes, I'm the dork that follows along with the "getting started" tutorials. No, I'm not any fun at parties. 

I opened this GitHub account so I can finish an assignment in the Odin Project. I am currently interested in teaching myself to learn what is needed to be a full stack developer.
